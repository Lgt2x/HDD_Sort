# HDD_Sort
A collection of small Python3 scripts to manage hard drives filled with movies (for my dad <3)

Current scripts:
 - ListFiles.py : given a source folder and a dest folder, creates a .txt list containing the name of every movie stored in the source directory (.mp4, .avi, .mkv)
 - Merge.py : merges all lists generated by ListFiles.py in a given directory
