# Movie collection managing
Python scripts to list and manage a movie collection

Available scripts:
 - ListFiles.py : given a source folder and a dest folder, creates a .txt list containing the name of every movie stored in the source directory (.mp4, .avi, .mkv)
 
 Usage: ``python3 [Path to script] [Path to hard drive] [Destination of the list] [Name given to the list]``
 - Merge.py : merges and sorts all lists generated by ListFiles.py in a given directory

Usage: ``python3 Merge.py [Path to director``

 - TwoColumns.py : makes the .csv file generated by Merge.py 2 columns wide

Usage: ``python3 TwoColumns.py .../merge.csv``
